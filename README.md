<h3>My Process</h3>
<p>
My first instinct was to understand the prototype given and break it down, utilising figma and referencing colours, font from the UI kit and design file.
I was accessing what would be dynamic and a smart component and what wouldn't be, whilst also considering what the component tree would look like.
The limited time, meant I had to extract what was achievable in the time and thought it was best to include what would make a whole page and give the basic essence of what the page is. 
</p>

<h3>What was Achieved?</h3>
<p>
This page is not outside of my capabilities and I wish I had more time, I tried to split my time in both planning and understanding the structure and identifying what parts make use of React and NextJS. I have committed to the time honestly, to showcase as much as everything in the limited time:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>I utliised Link from Next to create a working navigation bar</li>
   <li>Application has multiple pages</li>
  <li>CSS Styling using Flexbox</li>
  <li>Initial basic skeleton of page structure: Header, Body & Footer</li>
  <li>Component Organsation, component sbroken down further and some buried within each other for more readability in the component tree</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>
Personally, I would leave styling last, and focus on making sure functionality is working (I did some styling to showcase that I can use CSS)!
I would look to create the monthly price cards first then my next step would be to create a micro version of the dynamic component and create two buttons one for monthly and then yearly and useState to change the price total and the price point e.g. /monthly or /yearly. 

Please reference my project that takes that concept in action <a href="https://github.com/chisfy/Weather-Feeds-Phil">Weather Feeds Phil</a> in which a numerical and text value changes using state in React.

I would then move to the features section and create a resuable component for the features, my immediate thought was to create an array or .json file that holds the icon, title of feature and description and map that into a card component. Above that is obviously a title for the area with sub-text and that itself would be a seperate component and then complied into one larger component, as stated in the figjam breakdown of the page.

Considerations to consider with styling and setup is accessibility, semantic html, heading order as the application gets built and so forth.
